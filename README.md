# Share a game
## Next.js + MongoDB project

Demo app: https://board-games-sandy.vercel.app/

## Description

**Share a game** is a browser app which allows you to share, borrow and rent boarding games in your neighborhood. The project was created with Next.js and MongoDB.

### Features

- You can browse the games which are already in our database
- You can add a new game to the database
- You can rent or borrow a game
- You can read the details of the particular game

## About the project

The project was developed as training of Next.js with connection to MongoDB. It uses routing and server side rendering, fetching data from MongoDB, adding new items to the database. Current code is only the first step of planned project.

Redirecting to game details may take a while, as I use a free, training-friendly version of MongoDB cluster. Loading spinner is being prepared.


### Styling

The styling approach that I chose for this project is **CSS modules** in React. It helps to encapsulate styling for a particular component while having your styling in separated file, not withing .js file.

### Future scope

- Web scraping (probably with Cheerios) to automatically populate game description while adding a new game (currently in progress)
- Events, such as tournaments or just friendly playing, in your neighborhood (with Leaflet for rendering a map)
- Loading spinner, while fetching from MongoDB, as it takes a while
- Changing status of the game in database, after clicking "rent"
- Authentication
- Refactoring to minimize repetitions.
- Working "rent" and "waiting list" buttons
- Dashboard with your borrowed and rented games
- Fake payments with Stripe
- Understanding Image component, as I can't fit image size properly
